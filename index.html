            </header>
            <p>At its heart, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> is a fairly
                simple language made up of <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which can be applied
                to pieces of
                text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part
                of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of
                content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will
                introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to
                understand HTML.</p>
            <h1>Guides</h1>
            <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and
                provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started">Getting
                    started with HTML</a></h4>
            <p>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other
                important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is
                structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features.
                Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>

                    What’s in the head? Metadata in HTML</a></h4>
            <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is
                loaded. It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML
                content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote
                it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

                    HTML text fundamnetals</a></h4>
            <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how
                to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a
                structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

            <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements,
                attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into
                HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other
                important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!

            <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web
                browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark
                up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
                content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider
                the following line of text:</p>
            <code class="code-area">My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a
                paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
            <code class="code-area">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p class=note>Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or
                lowercase. For example, a title tag could be written as title, TITLE, Title, TiTlE, etc., and
                it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for
                consistency and readability.</p>

                </h1>
            </header>
            <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

            </p>
            <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All HTML elements can have attributes</li>
                <li>Attributes provide additional information about elements
                </li>
                <li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag
                </li>
                <li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
                </li>
                <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Iure, reiciendis?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The href Attribute</h3>
            <p>The < a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:</p>
            <code class="code-area"> &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools&lt;/a> </code>
            <h3>The src Attribute</h3>
            <p>The < img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the
                    image to be displayed:</p>
            <code class="code-area">&lt;img src="img_girl.jpg"></code>

            <p>
                HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
            </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <code>
                <h1>Heading 1</h1>
                <h2>Heading 2</h2>
                <h3>Heading 3</h3>
                <h4>Heading 4</h4>
                <h5>Heading 5</h5>
                <h6>Heading 6</h6>
            </code>
            <h3>HTML Headings</h3>
            <p>HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1> to &lt;h6> tags.

                &lt;h1> defines the most important heading. &lt;h6> defines the least important heading.</p>
            <code class="code-area">&lt;h1>Heading 1&lt;/h1>
                <br>
                &lt;h2>Heading 2&lt;/h2>

                <h1>HTML Paragraphs</h1>
            </header>
            <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
            </p>
            <h3>HTML Paragraphs</h3>
            <p>The HTML &lt;p> element defines a paragraph.

                A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin)
                before and after a paragraph.</p>
            <code class="code-area">
                &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>
                <br>
                &lt;p>This is another paragraph.&lt;/p>
